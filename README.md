color clock

An interesting idea for a clock for a website.

Since the time changes every second, you can generate something that changes on the site as well, using only clock data.
You can use these numbers from the clock to change the background color using the hexadecimal color format.

That is, using pure JS, using SetInterval to change the data from the Date object every second, we also change our background in the same SetInterval.
